sinatra_auth_github
===================

A sinatra extension that provides oauth authentication to github.  Find out more about enabling your application at github's [oauth quickstart](http://gist.github.com/419219).

To test it out on localhost set your callback url to 'http://localhost:9393/auth/github/callback'

The gist of this project is to provide a few things easily:

* authenticate a user against github's oauth service
* provide an easy way to make API requests for the authenticated user
* optionally restrict users to a specific github organization
* optionally restrict users to a specific github team

Installation
============

    % gem install sinatra_auth_github

Running the Example
===================
    % gem install bundler
    % bundle install
    % GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<from GH>" GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<from GH>" bundle exec rackup -p9393

There's an example app in [spec/app.rb](/atmos/sinatra_auth_github/blob/master/spec/app.rb).

Example App Functionality
=========================

You can simply authenticate via GitHub by hitting http://localhost:9292

You can check organization membership by hitting http://localhost:9292/orgs/github

You can check team membership by hitting http://localhost:9292/teams/42

All unsuccessful authentication requests get sent to the securocat denied page.

API Requests
============

The extension also provides a simple way to do get requests against the
GitHub API as the authenticated user.

    def repos
      github_request("user/repos")
    end

There's awesome docs on the v3 API [available here](http://developer.github.com/v3/).
